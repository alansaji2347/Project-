# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

As of now, zero clue. Possible ideas I pulled out of a hat:
  - ScheduleMe
  - TUEasy

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

My project would consist of a site that will make a students daily life easier due to the whole virtual setting. This website will allow individuals
  to add links to their most important sites such as canvas, a university site, and many others. It will also allow them to create the schedule of classes they
    are currently taking as well as setting reminders to assignemnts they will need to complete. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My software will allows students to manually enter important details needed for everyday school use. As I said earlier, links, scheduling, reminders, and possibly more.
  I plan on also inputting a search bar which will redirect users to Google after entering a word or sentence they need better understanding of. 
    Of course, I do not want to clutter everything into one whole page, so I am planning on making tabs which will allow the site to stay organized.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

The main thing out of the site I would want to accomplish would definitely be the three major ideas I proposed. Links, scheduling, and reminders. I plan on
  adding more features in the future, but as of now, these three are a must.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

- Search Bar
- Link Box 
- Schedule 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope to accomplish everything I stated in the previous questions. Even if I do not finish, I do plan on still completing it. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

  The skills that are required regarding the website creation, I would need to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Learning HTML and CSS is not that difficult, but 
but I still worry about JavaScript since it is a new language. Another major issue I have trouble understanding is the whole website URL things. From my text editor,
I am able to just open a test page, but not an actual website name. For example, nobody wants to enter random numbers to get to a site so instead, they add a simple
website URL like "Google.com". Of course, I have seen the whole HTTP videos and stuff, but I am still having trouble understanding the whole concept of the URL.
  In terms of working with my partner, we have not gotten to the parts where we choose who does what, but we are in the agreement with our website idea.
